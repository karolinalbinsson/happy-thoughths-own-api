# Happy Thoughts

This weeks assignment was to create a site for viewing and posting messages from/to the happy thoughts API. The main focus was using state hooks and useEffect.

## The problem

I started out trying out the requests in postman to learn how to do them. Then I implemented the fetch of messages in my app. Later on i created a form and implemented the post-message functionality. After that was working I moved on to the like-request. Finally I added a like-counter that saves the number of likes posts to a variable in local storage, which is used as initial state for the like-counter.
