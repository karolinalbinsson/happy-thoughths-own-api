# Happy Thoughts

This weeks assignment was to create a site for viewing and posting messages from/to the happy thoughts API. The main focus was using state hooks and useEffect.
This project is a copy of the happy thoughts project, but using my own api and database.
Repo for backend: https://github.com/karolinalbinsson/project-happy-thoughts-api
